# Ext JS: Sharing Snippets

Sencha provides an advanced "fiddle" service for sharing snippets of code for any released framework/version/toolkit:

**[fiddle.sencha.com](https://fiddle.sencha.com)**

This is especially useful when you think you've found a bug in the framework. If you can reproduce an issue in a
minimal Fiddle, you can rule out any problem with yoru environment and easily share the test case
with Sencha support or the Sencha community via the forums or StackOverflow. It is also useful for publishing examples
and for seeking help getting built-in functionality behaving like you want without needing to share your entire environment.

For best results, register an account on Sencha's forum and use that account to sign into Fiddle and save your Fiddles.

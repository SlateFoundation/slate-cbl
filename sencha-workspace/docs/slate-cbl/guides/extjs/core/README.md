# Ext JS: The Core

The "core" of Ext JS is the bare minimum set of JavaScript code you need to load into your page before you start using the
framework. The UI toolkits commonly associated with Ext JS are not part of the core, but can be incrementally loaded on
top of it. The core provides a foundation comperable to frameworks like jQuery, but with an added emphasis on enabling
the creation of reusable and integratable JavaScript code and UI components.

## Loading the Core
The bare minimum you need to load into your page to use Ext JS is `build/ext-debug.js` or it's minified
form `build/ext.js` from the framework's distribution archive. These includes all sources from the framework
"tagged" with `// @tag core` or `// @tag class`.

The other stock builds available in the archive include various themes and bundles of UI components on top of the
core that are useful if you want to use those higher-level components without doing any custom builds or configuring the loader.

The [HTML template](../eg-iframe.html) powering all the inline examples in these docs loads the Ext JS core JavaScript build
from Sencha's CDN:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.sencha.com/ext/commercial/6.0.0/build/ext-all-debug.js"></script>

That HTML template _also_ loads a stock build of the `triton` theme for the `classic` UI toolkit, but that is only needed to
provide styling for later guides that get into using components from the UI toolkits. UI toolkit classes can be loaded by the
core builds but none are included in them, and having a theme loaded is not a requirement for using any of the core JavaScript
library described in this guide.

To verify that the core is loaded, query `Ext.getVersion('core')` in your console or via a JavaScript snippet in your page:

    @example
    alert('Ext JS version: ' + Ext.getVersion('core').toString());


## Included in the Core

asset loading and platform detection

  - [`Ext.Number`*](http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/6.0/6.0.0-classic/#!/api/Ext.Number)
  - [`Ext.Object`*](http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/6.0/6.0.0-classic/#!/api/Ext.Object)
- The foundation for Ext JS' [class system](http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/6.0/core_concepts/classes.html)
  - [`Ext.Config`](http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/6.0/6.0.0-classic/#!/api/Ext.Config): Manages `config` properties for classes and
  their workflows
  - [`Ext.Base`](http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/6.0/6.0.0-classic/#!/api/Ext.Base): The root prototype of all Ext JS-defined
  JavaScript classes

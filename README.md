## Technologies used

- [Emergence](http://emergence.sh): Open toolkit for building and running web applications
- [Slate](http://slate.is): Foundational web application for schools
- [Sencha Ext JS 6 Classic](http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/6.2.0/): Web-based UI framework with rich components library
- Sencha CMD 6.x: Build tools for web UI applications built with Sencha Ext JS
- [Habitat](http://habitat.sh): Provides portable and isolated environments for testing and building

## Getting started with client-side UI application development

1. Install habitat

    ```bash
    curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/habitat-sh/habitat/master/components/hab/install.sh | sudo bash
    ```

1. Set up habitat

    When prompted, enter `slate` as your default origin and choose yes to generate a key

    ```bash
    hab setup
    ```

1. Clone `slate-cbl` repository and all submodules

    ```bash
    git clone --recursive -b develop git@github.com:SlateFoundation/slate-cbl.git
    ```

1. Change into cloned `slate-cbl` directory

    ```bash
    cd ./slate-cbl
    ```

1. Ensure repository and all submodules are initialized and up-to-date

    ```bash
    ./pull
    ```

1. Launch habitat studio

    On Linux, just run:

    ```bash
    hab studio enter
    ```

    On Mac or Windows, prefix this command with additional options to expose the development web server outside the studio:

    ```bash
    HAB_DOCKER_OPTS="-p 3901:3901" hab studio enter
    ```

Read the notes printed to your terminal at the end of the studio startup process for instructions on how to access applications in your browser and on what commands are available.

### Client-side UI application documentation

View the latest docs online at [http://slatefoundation.github.io/slate-cbl/](http://slatefoundation.github.io/slate-cbl/)

To update these docs, run `build.sh` and then `publish.sh` within `sencha-workspace/docs`

### Connecting to a server

You can connect to any remote slate-cbl instance that has CORS enabled by appending the query
parameter `apiHost` when loading the page.

## Installing to a `v2.slate.is` server

1. Copy [sample `slate-cbl.php` git config script](https://github.com/SlateFoundation/slate-cbl/blob/releases/v2/php-config/Git.config.d/slate-cbl.php) into site
1. Visit `/site-admin/sources` and initialize the `slate-cbl` source
1. Return to `/site-admin/sources/slate-cbl` and click <kbd>Sync</kbd> â†’ <kbd>Update emergence VFS</kbd> for the `slate-cbl` layer
1. Push sencha builds to instance, logging in with a developer account when prompted: `http://cbl.projects.jarv.us/push-builds?ref=releases/v2&host=SITE_HOSTNAME`
   - Alternatively, builds may be created locally and uploaded to `sencha-build/APP_NAME/production`

## Best Practices

- Use `select`/`clear` events instead of `change` to monitor navigation combos for route updates -- they only fire in response to direct user input
- Ensure blank components aren't appended to paths
- Use apply->update config flow for subcomponents

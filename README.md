## Technologies used
- Emergence
- Slate
- Sencha CMD 6.x
- [Sencha Ext JS 6 Classic](http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/6.0/)


## Getting started with client-side UI application development
1. [Install latest 6.x Sencha CMD](https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/cmd-download/)
2. `git clone --recursive -b develop git@github.com:SlateFoundation/slate-cbl.git`
3. `cd ./slate-cbl`
4. `./build-all-apps.sh`

If you have a version of GIT older than 1.6, get a newer version of git.

Then run a web server from `sencha-workspace` or higher in your file tree and navigate to the subdirectory for the app you want to run in your browser. If you don't have a server you can run `sencha web start`
to run a basic local server at [http://localhost:1841](http://localhost:1841).

### Client-side UI application documentation

View the latest docs online at [http://slatefoundation.github.io/slate-cbl/](http://slatefoundation.github.io/slate-cbl/)

To update these docs, run `build.sh` and then `publish.sh` within `sencha-workspace/docs`

### Connecting to a server
You can connect to any remote slate-cbl instance that has CORS enabled by appending the query
parameter `apiHost` when loading the page.


## Installing to a `v2.slate.is` server
1. Copy [sample `slate-cbl.php` git config script](https://github.com/SlateFoundation/slate-cbl/blob/releases/v2/php-config/Git.config.d/slate-cbl.php) into site
2. Visit `/site-admin/sources` and initialize the `slate-cbl` source
3. Return to `/site-admin/sources/slate-cbl` and click <kbd>Sync</kbd> â†’ <kbd>Update emergence VFS</kbd> for the `slate-cbl` layer
4. Push sencha builds to instance, logging in with a developer account when prompted: `http://cbl.projects.jarv.us/push-builds?ref=releases/v2&host=SITE_HOSTNAME`
  - Alternatively, builds may be created locally and uploaded to `sencha-build/APP_NAME/production`

# Student Competency Functions

| Method Name | Description | Output |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------ |
| getDemonstrationData | Get demonstrations, **grouped** by `SkillID` and **ordered** by `DemonstrationDate` and `DemonstrationID` | Array of demonstrations
| getDemonstrationOpportunities | Equal to the total amount of **non-Override demonstrations** found in `getDemonstrationData` | Array of demonstrations
| sortDemonstrations | Demonstrations are sorted by their `ID` | Array of demonstrations
| sortEffectiveDemonstrations | Sort demonstrations by `DemonstratedLevel`, or by the `sortDemonstrations` method if the demonstrations have the same `DemonstratedLevel` | Array of demonstrations
| getEffectiveDemonstrationsData | Sort `getDemonstrationData` via `sortEffectiveDemonstrations`. Reduce the number of demonstrations to the amount of *demonstrations required for the respective `Level`*. Sort the demonstrations again via `sortDemonstrations` | Array of demonstrations
| getDemonstrationsLogged | Get demonstrations via `getEffectiveDemonstrationsData`. Exclude **Overrides** and records that do not have a **DemonstratedLevel**. | Total of demonstrations found
| getDemonstrationsMissed | Get demonstrations via `getEffectiveDemonstrationsData`. Exclude **Overrides** and records that have a **DemonstratedLevel** | Total of demonstrations found
| getDemonstrationsComplete | Get demonstrations via `getEffectiveDemonstrationsData`. If `DemonstratedLevel` is set, Increase the total by **1**. If record is an **Override**, Increase the total by the amount of demonstrations required for the respective Skill Level (via `Skill::getDemonstrationsRequiredByLevel()`). If the Demonstration is an **Override**, equal to the the amount of skills required for that demonstration. | Total of demonstrations completed
| getDemonstrationsAverage | Equal to the total of `DemonstratedLevel` for demonstrations via `getEffectiveDemonstrations` that are *not an Override*, **divided** by the amount of demonstrations via `getDemonstrationsLogged`. (*There must be at least one demonstration logged.*) | Average **DemonstratedLevel** for demonstrations
| getDemonstrationsRequired | Get demonstrations required for the respective **`Competency`** and **`Level`** | Total of demonstrations required
| getMinimumAverage | Get minimum average rating for the respective **Level**. This can be implemented in the following ways. Implementation will vary based on Slate configuration. Either: Hard-coded array of **Levels** mapped to the custom **Minimum Average** OR Hard-coded function that can determine the **Minimum Average** based on the **StudentComptency** OR Hard-coded **Minimum Average** value. | Minimum Average Rating
| getMinimumRating | Get minimum rating for the respective **Level**. This can be implemented in the following ways. Implementation will vary based on Slate configuration. Either: Hard-coded array of **Levels** mapped to the custom **Minimum Rating** OR Hard-coded function that can determine the **Minimum Rating** based on the **StudentComptency** OR Hard-coded **Minimum Rating** value | Minimum Rating
| isLevelComplete | Determine if the respective **Level** is completed by: Getting the total of demonstrations (Evidence Required) for the respective **Competency** and confirming that The amount of demonstrations completed (via `getDemonstrationsCompleted`) is greater than or equal to the amount of Evidence Required AND The average demonstration rating (via `getDemonstrationsAverage`) is greater than or equal to the minimum average (via `getMinimumAverage`) AND All ratings (via `getEffectiveDemonstrations`) are above the minimum rating (via `getMinimumRating`). Custom **Level Is Complete** function that determines if the level is completed for the given **StudentCompetency** Implementation will vary based on Slate configuration. | **True** or **False**

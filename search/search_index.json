For each skill, you subtract the oldest from the most recent demonstration and then average this skill growth with all the other skills in that competency and portfolio level that had multiple numerical logs (and thus could calculate growth). Skills that have only one demonstration can not have growth and thus are NULL for growth. If within a competency, only one skill has growth for the given portfolio level, the growth of the competency equals the growth of that one skill.

For each skill, you subtract the oldest from the most recent demonstration and then average this skill growth with all the other skills that have growth in the given competency at that level. Then, you average the growth for each competency to calculate the growth for the content area. This means that if a single skill within a competency is the only one that has growth, the growth for that skill is treated as the competency growth and factors strongly into the averaging. If no skill in a competency has growth (they\u2019re all NULL), then the competency growth is NULL and should not count towards the content-area growth average.

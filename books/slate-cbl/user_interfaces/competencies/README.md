# Competency Overview

### Demonstrations that show in the grid

* Demonstrations fill left to right based on the date logged
* When empty cells remain, all logged demonstrations \(whether a number or M\) fill the next empty cell moving left to right 
* The top X scores show for each standard where X is the number of evidence requirements for that standard
* If multiple equivalent scores exceed the number of demonstrations required, the most recent score should be shown
* If X scores have not been logged, Missed Demonstrations appear at the end
  -Lower scores and Ms are replaced when higher scores are logged

### Completion progress of each competency

* Calculated as total demonstrations counted towards each standardsâ€™ completion divided by total demonstrations required for the entire competency
* For each standard, the maximum demonstrations counted towards completion of the competency is the total number of evidence requirements for that standard 

### Average score in a competency

* Calculated as the average of the top X logged demonstrations for each standard where X is the number of evidence requirements for each standard 
* Once a competency is 50% complete, if the average score is below the minimum passing threshold, the average score remains fixed in the cell with a red notation behind it
* Overrides do not count towards a competency average and should be ignored. This means that if an Override serves to complete multiple demonstrations, the denominator of the average is reduced by the number of demonstrations that override counts for. 

### Progressing to the next competency level

* Student earns completion record for competency when they meet these two conditions
  * Have at least the minimum number of demonstrations logged for each of that competency standards
  * The average score across all standards in that competency is at least X-.5 where X is the current level \(e.g. 8.5 minimum average for level 9\)
* In the future, growth criteria should be added as an alternative promotion metric where growth is calculated as the average of the most recent demonstration for each standard minus the average of the first demonstration for each standard

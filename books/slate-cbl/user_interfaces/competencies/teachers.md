# Teacher Competency Dashboard

## Selecting a Student Group

* The drop down menu “Students” produces a menu of all course sections and groups in Slate
* When selected, the students assigned to the given course section or group populate the x axis
* The list of students sorts alphabetically by last name, first name, and is scrollable left and right

## Selecting a Content Area

* The drop down menu “Content Area” produces a list of all content areas uploaded from the Competency Map during setup
* The selected content area populates the y axis with the competencies and standards under that content area

## Logging a Demonstration

* The “Log a Demonstration” window can be initiated from the teacher view or within a Skill Overview window
* Teachers can log demonstrations within one competency or multiple competencies at the same time
* Teachers can rate one or more standards within each competency
* Student, Type of Context, Experience and Performance Task are required fields
  Artifact \(URL\) and notes are optional fields

## Next Student button

* This feature allows teachers to quickly evaluate multiple students that have submitted similar projects or assignments without having to reload the details and competencies multiple times
* When selected, after submitting the demonstration, the Student field changes to the next student \(alphabetically\) in the loaded group or course section
* After moving to the next student, the following fields are retained: Type of Performance, Context, Performance Task, selected competencies and standards evaluated
  Reset artifact URL, comments, and selected levels

## Override

* For students performing well above their current level on a specific standard, teachers can override the remaining demonstrations required and complete that standard for a specific student
* The remaining empty cells in that standard fill in as completed with the current level’s color and are marked with an O rather than the evaluated level
* If an M is present in the standard, the M is replaced with a completed O cell in the gridview, in the detail view the M is still visible.
* Overrides have a DemosntratedLevel equal to the TargetLevel \(the current portfolio\) but do not factor into competency averages.

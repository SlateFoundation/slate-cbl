description: |
  A `StudentCompetency` record captures a student's state on a particular competency+level combination.

  In addition to the data stored via this database model, the `StudentCompetency` class also hosts the core
  calculation workflow methods for student progress, performance, and growth since they are based on the
  intersection of Student+Competency+Level.
